## Usage

**Get Money Wrapper Instance**

By default, MYR, Malaysia Ringgit currency will be use. 

You may override either by `.env` file or pass the country Alpha 2 code when calling `money()` helper.

```php
$money = money(); // by default it will use MY
$moneyUsd = money('US'); // pass the country code - ISO Alpha 2
```

You can add more currencies after publishing the Money Wrapper configuration file and added more supported currencies.

Please refer to [Country Code](http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm) and it's currency swift code and symbol in [Currency List](http://www.xe.com/iso4217.php).

**Get Money Format**

```php
echo money()->toHuman(100); // RM 1.00, useful for human readability
echo money()->toCommon(100); // 1.00
echo money()->toMachine('1.00'); // 100, always store in database as integer. 
```

**Convert Fixed Rate**

```php
$fixedExchange = [
    'MYR' => [
        'USD' => 3.87,
    ],
];
echo money()->convertFixedRate($fixedExchange, 100, 'USD')->getAmount(); // 387
```

> Recommended data type used in database is big integer

## Contributions

Updating currency list (`config/currency.php`) available based on following resources:

1. Use Country ISO Alpha 2 Code for the Key as defined in [Country List](http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm).
2. Refer [currency list](http://www.xe.com/iso4217.php) for the available currency.
3. Use symbol as per stated in [www.xe.com](http://www.xe.com/symbols.php).

The structure will be as following:

```php
[
	'IN' => [
		'swift_code' => 'INR',
		'symbol' => 'â‚¹'
	]
]
```
